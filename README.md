* User interface/experience (UI/UX): 1) Build out features for our current 311 data portal (http://dc311portal.codefordc.org/) OR 2) Design and start to develop an application to view and report restaurant violations.

## Contribute your code

Start by forking this repository to your Github account (click "Fork" in the top right).
Then clone the forked version of the repository to your computer using the URL listed under "Clone or Download". 
```
$ git clone <url-of-your-fork>
```
We use a triangular workflow - you should push to your Github account's fork, but fetch/pull from this master repository. Setting this up requires adding a remote to this repository account. "Git clone" will have created your repository in a new folder called "dc_doh_hackathon". Use these commands to add the remote to that new folder:
```
$ cd dc_doh_hackathon
$ git remote add dohhackathon https://github.com/jasonasher/dc_doh_hackathon.git
$ git remote -v
  #you should see this:
  dohhackathon       https://github.com/jasonasher/dc_doh_hackathon.git (fetch)
  dohhackathon       https://github.com/jasonasher/dc_doh_hackathon.git (push)
  origin          <your/forked/url> (push)
  origin          <your/forked/url> (fetch)
```
Now instead of plain `git push` and `git pull`, use these:

```
$ git push origin <branch-name>       #pushes to your forked repo
$ git pull dohhackathon <branch-name>   #fetches and merges from the dohhackathon repo
```

Please push your code to the folder labeled with your task!
